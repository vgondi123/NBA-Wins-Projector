# NBA-Wins-Projector

## Description
What I set out to accomplish with this project was to be able to build a predictive model that could predict the number of games an NBA team will win. While many NBA predictive models predict how many wins a team will have based on in-season stats, I wanted my model to predict wins on a different basis. My model only uses statistics from seasons prior to the target season. This was done because the sole purpose of what I set out to do was to figure out which teams will be good or not before the season starts. To create the model, three methods of data science were used: web scraping, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning.

## Setup
I used Jupyter Notebook with Python as the language to complete this project.

## Part 1 - Web Scraping
